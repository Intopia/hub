        <h3>Course outline</h3>
        <h4>Hands-on activities</h4>
        <p>The hands-on activities give attendees the opportunity to explore different technologies and settings that people with disability use. The activities are performed in groups of at least 3 people. Each person takes on a role of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Moderator - the person who is guiding the “participant” through their task</li>
          <li>Participant - the person who is acting as the “participant”, adopts a person and tries to complete the task</li>
          <li>Observer - the person who is watching the “participant” and making notes about a person’s experience</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Attendees swap roles after each activity. During the activity, each group:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>watches a short video for context</li>
          <li>sets up for the activity</li>
          <li>does the activity</li>
          <li>discusses what they observed</li>
          <li>reads tips for creating a more accessible experience</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The activities below are example activities. We will work with you to refine the activities based on the technology you have access to, such as Windows or Mac, and whether you can install other software such as addons or plugins.</p>
        <h4>Keyboard</h4>
        <p>Participants are asked to complete a task using only the keyboard. People with some types of physical impairment will rely on the keyboard for navigation.</p>
        <h4>Cognitive fatigue</h4>
        <p>Participants start with a number of “spoons” which represents the amount of mental or physical energy someone has at the start of the day. Participants are presented with a number of tasks and options for that task. Their choices use spoons. Spoon theory was first coined by Christine Miserandino, who lives with lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease that causes an immune system to attack the body’s healthy cells.</p>
        <h4>Screen magnification</h4>
        <p>Participants complete a task using a screen magnifier which is software that makes your screen bigger by “magnifying” it. People with low vision often use screen magnifiers to be able to more easily see content.</p>
        <h4>Interface adaptation</h4>
        <p>Participants complete a task with certain interface changes turned on, such as high contrast (black background with white text) or increased text size. People with low vision often change the inteface to suit their needs.</p>
        <h4>Delivery</h4>
        <p>This course is run as two 1.5-hour sessions. It is delivered live and online using Zoom. We prefer to use Zoom because of the platform’s accessibility and functionality. We can discuss the use of other platforms if you have software restrictions.</p>
